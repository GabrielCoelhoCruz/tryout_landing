}

## Plan

1. **Phase 1: Data Modernization**
   - Extract pricing details from hardcoded JSX in `src/app/page.tsx` to a new `PRICING_PLANS` constant in `src/constants/landing-data.ts`. [completed]
   - Structure: `id, name, description, features: { label, sublabel, price }[], highlight, color, icon`.

2. **Phase 2: Component Architecture**
   - Create `src/components/PricingCard.tsx`: [completed]
     - Implement a modern SaaS-style card with clean typography.
     - Add hover animations using Framer Motion (scale, glow effect matching the team colors).
     - Include a CTA button that scrolls to the `#formulario` section.
     - Support for "Highlight" state (e.g., "Best Value" badge).
   - Create `src/components/PricingTabs.tsx` (optional but recommended for mobile): [cancelled]
     - A toggle switch to change between "Uma Equipe" and "Múltiplas Equipes" views.

3. **Phase 3: Integration and Refactoring**
   - Replace the existing pricing section in `src/app/page.tsx` with a new layout using the `PricingCard` components. [completed]
   - Use a `Tabs` or `Toggle` logic for switching plans if the screen is mobile, or side-by-side for desktop.
   - Refine the PIX info area to be more integrated and less "attached".

4. **Phase 4: Validation and Polish**
   - Verify responsiveness on mobile/tablet/desktop. [completed]
   - Ensure color consistency with the updated palette (`#FF7F00`, `#00BFFF`). [completed]
   - Check accessibility (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation). [completed]

## Rules
- Use Framer Motion for all transitions.
- Stick to the project's color palette (Orange `#FF7F00`, Blue `#00BFFF`).
- Avoid "AI generic look" by using bold typography (Bebas Neue) and specific team-related terminology.
